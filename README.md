# Statistical-Learning-
9th semester Statistical Learning Mini Project

This project aims to classify human activities using sensor data collected from a smartphone. The data used in this project comes from experiments that recorded the movements of participants performing various activities like walking, standing, and sitting. The main goal is to leverage machine learning techniques to accurately identify these activities from the provided data.

1. Data Preprocessing:
Load the data and handle any missing values.
Split the data into training and testing sets.

2. Feature Scaling:
Apply normalization or standardization to bring all features to a similar scale, which is crucial for better model performance.

3. Dimensionality Reduction:
Use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data and visualize the separation between different activities.

4. Model Training and Evaluation:
Train classifiers like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) to predict activities.
Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

5. Visualization:
Visualize the PCA results and plot confusion matrices to understand model performance.
